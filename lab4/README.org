* Introduction
In this project we learn the characteristics of charge coupled devices
(CCD) which are indispensable when acquiring astronomical data with
telescopes. The data calalogued in Table [[tab:data]] was collected by
other students using the science-grade ~ST-10XME~ (identified as ~SBIG
ST-10 3 CCD Camera~ in the FITS headers) whose most relevant
manufacturer specifications are given in Table [[tab:spec]].

In this report, we provide estimates of the gain and read noise;
investigate the range of linearity of the CCD (where the output signal
is proportional to the input); and finally study how the dark current
depends on the sensor's temperature[fn:dc].

In what follows, ~astropy~ was used to handle the FITS files and
conduct the analysis. The source code will be available under
[[https://github.com/wdecay/ASTR480/tree/master/lab4]].

[fn:dc] The dark current study uses a different dataset taken with
~SBIG ST-8XE~ detector.
* Gain & Read Noise
The gain is estimated using the formula
#+NAME: eq:gain
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Gain} = \frac{(\bar{F_1}+\bar{F_2}) - (\bar{B_1}+\bar{B_2})}{\sigma^2_{F_1 - F_2}-\sigma^2_{B_1 - B_2}},
\end{equation}
where $F_{1,2}$ and $B_{1,2}$ are different regions (of the same size
and dimension) in, respectively, a flat field and bias frames. For
this analysis, two different bias frames with the same CCD temperature
(see Table [[tab:data]]) were used; namely,
~480_2018_.Bias(0.0S0X1).03.fits~ and
~480_2018_.Bias(0.0S0X1).05.fits~. Given that all flat field frames
had been taken with different exposures, the two flat field regions
were extracted from the same frame, ~480_2018_.Flat.20S0X1.R.24.fits~
with the exposure time of $\SI{20}{\second}$ (at which the CCD behaves
linearly). Figure [[fig:rgn]] shows a possible region arrangement on a
flat field image.

#+CAPTION: Flat field frame ~480_2018_.Flat.20S0X1.R.24.fits~ with two $120\times 120$ pixel regions.
#+CAPTION: Region #1 was also used against the two bias frames.
#+NAME: fig:rgn
[[./img/regions.png]]

Plugging in the statistics computed for the regions in Figure [[fig:rgn]]
into Equation ([[eq:gain]]), we obtain
\[
\mathrm{Gain} = \frac{(8930.8 + 9014.7) - (1018.1 + 1018.9)}{113.1^2 - 12.0^2} \approx 1.26\ e^-/\mathrm{ADU}
\]

Read noise in electrons can be estimated as
\[
\mathrm{Read\ Noise} = \frac{\mathrm{Gain}\times\sigma_{(B_1 - B_2)}}{\sqrt{2}}
= \frac{1.26\times 12.0}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 10.7e^-,
\]
which corresponds to the read noise of
\[
10.7e^- / 1.26\ e^-/\mathrm{ADU} \approx 8.5\ \mathrm{ADU}
\]

Results of identical calculations for various region sizes are given
in Table [[tab:rs]]. It is evident that the gain is somewhere within the
range between 1.25 and 1.35, in agreement with the
$1.3e^-/\mathrm{ADU}$ value given specification (Table [[tab:spec]]). The
estimated read noise of about $10.7e^-$, however, slightly exceeded
the value given by the manufacturer ($8.8e^-$ RMS); this can be due to
thermal effects or high-frequency noise in the power grid.

* Linearity
Mean pixel values and standard deviations for a series of flat field
frames with different exposures were calculated for two different
regions. The first region is marked as #2 in Figure [[fig:rgn]], whereas
the second region (selected from the part of the flats exhibiting
greatest saturation) is shown in Figure [[fig:sat]]. CCD characteristics
based on these two regions are summarized in Tables [[tab:lin]], [[tab:linh]]
and Figures [[fig:lin]], [[fig:linh]].

The reason for using two different regions is that the data point
corresponding to a $\SI{60}{\second}$ exposure in Table [[tab:lin]] and
Figure [[fig:lin]] looks rather suspicious: extrapolating the linear
behavior preceding $\SI{60}{\second}$ exposure would predict that the
mean pixel value should not exceed 30000 ADU (which, according to
Figure [[fig:linh]] is within the linear range of the CCD); however, it
gets almost as high as 50000 ADU (Table [[tab:lin]]). Why did the sensor
start behaving non-linearly much earlier than we would expect?

#+CAPTION: Data from Table [[tab:linh]].
#+NAME: fig:linh
[[./img/linearity_better.png]]

Table [[tab:linh]] and Figure [[fig:linh]] provide a clue. About a third of
the sensor (see Figure [[fig:sat]]) is already saturated in the
$\SI{60}{\second}$ flat frame. This may affect the characteristics of
the seemingly unsaturated areas of the image via effects such as
blooming (the overflowing of excess electrons into adjacent pixels) or
due to built-in (and often undocumented) mechanisms which protect the
sensor from permanent damage. Note the strange peak in the standard
deviation (Poissonian noise) at $\SI{60}{\second}$ Table [[tab:lin]] which
is not present in the burned-out region (Table [[tab:linh]]). It is
unclear what is the nature of this anomaly, but it may be related to
the aforementioned built-in damage control or burn-out prevention
mechanisms implemented by the manufacturer.

It is worth mentioning that the flat fields data set could be improved
by taking more "regular" images without such a significant difference
in contrast; it also would have been useful to take more data points
with exposures between $\SI{45}{\second}$ and $\SI{60}{\second}$ to
better understand the transition from linear to non-linear regime.

** Questions
*** Importance of staying within the linear range of the CCD
    Staying within the linear range allows direct comparison between
    the brightness of different objects that appear in the image. For
    example, if one star gives twice as much flux as the other and we
    are operating in the linear regime, the ADU values corresponding
    to each star will also exhibit the same ratio. Operating outside
    the linear regime makes things more complicated as ADU values will
    no longer correspond to the actual flux. Sometimes it may be
    necessary to work somewhat outside of the linear range; in that
    case CCD characteristics need to be taken into account during data
    analysis. If possible, staying within the linear range is always
    preferred.
*** Full-well capacity vs ADU saturation
    In 1x1 binning full-well capacity is reached first. This can be
    seen in the data given in Table [[tab:linh]] and Figure [[fig:linh]]. ADU
    saturation occurs when $N_{e^-}/\mathrm{Gain}$ exceeds
    $2^{16}-1=65635$. We see, however, that the pixels saturate at
    about 58000 ADU, which corresponds to $N_{e^-} \approx 76000$.
    This matches the full well capacity of approximately 77000 given
    in the specification (Table [[tab:spec]]).
*** Linearity range of the detector
    Based on the data presented in Tables [[tab:lin]] and [[tab:linh]], it is
    reasonable to conclude the linearity range of this detector is
    safely below 20000 ADU. Note that at short exposures and when the
    counts are low, there's a "dark" zone, which based on the data may
    extend up to 5000 ADU. The upper limit may go up to 30000 ADU (see
    Figure [[fig:linh]]). Due to the flats' being irregular and as per the
    above discussion, these conclusions are rather tentative. It does
    appear, however, that the linear range should be roughly between
    5000 and 30000 ADU during normal operation (i.e., in the absence
    of excessive highlights in the frame).
*** Different camera
    The ADU saturation given a 16 bit A/D converter occurs at
    \[
    2^{16}\ \mathrm{ADU} \times 1.6e^-/\mathrm{ADU} \approx 105000.
    \]
    Thus we need to worry about ADU saturation and not about exceeding
    the full-well capacity.

    In the case of 2x2 binning, the effective full-well capacity
    becomes $4\times 150000 = 600000$. The A/D converter is still
    16-bin, so clearly ADU saturation would be reached first. It is,
    however, not typically a problem as binning is useful when
    observing fainter objects.

*** Filters
    Based on the quantum efficiency plot for the ~KAF-3200ME~ CCD
    provided by the manufacturer, the camera is designed for visible
    light. The efficiency drops drastically for UV light and is
    effectively zero for wavelengths shorter than
    $\SI{300}{\nano\meter}$. If observing in near UV with this camera,
    it would make sense to use binning in order to minimize the effect
    of read noise. Analogously, the quantum efficiency drops for near
    infrared and reaches zero for wavelengths longer than
    $\SI{1000}{nm}$. Therefore, when observing with either UV or IR
    filters, ADU saturation will be much less likely (given reasonable
    exposures and intensity) because the quantum efficiency of the
    detector is substantially lower than that in the for visible
    light. (The question was a little vague --- not exactly sure what
    numbers 1 and 2 it was referring to. I assumed it was the previous
    question about saturation.)

* Dark Current
  The input data and derived quantities used in this analysis are
  summarized in Table [[tab:dc]]. To compute the list column, bias was
  multiplied by gain ($2.3\ e^-/\mathrm{ADU}$) and divided by the
  exposure time in seconds ($\SI{120}{\second}$).

We fit the function $D = Ke^{-bx}$ to the data from the last two
columns of Table [[tab:dc]] is shown in Figure [[fig:dc]]. From the fit
parameters, we determine that the band gap is
\[
E_g = 2k_Bb = 1.2\pm\SI{0.1}{\electronvolt},
\]

which reasonably well agrees with the accepted value of
$\SI{1.1}{\electronvolt}$.

** Questions
*** Limiting cases for the dark current
    From the equation,
    \begin{equation}
    D = 2.5\times10^{15} AI_dT^{1.5}e^{-E_g/2kT}
    \end{equation}

    it is easy to see that at high values of $T$, the exponential
    becomes unity and $D\propto T^{1.5}$. This prediction, however, is
    quite meaningless: at room temperature,
    $kT\approx\SI{0.026}{electronvolt}$, so in order for the "high
    temperature" behavior to set in we needs that $kT \gg E_g$, or $kT
    \gg \SI{1.1}{\electronvolt}$. Clearly, even $kT =
    \SI{1.1}{\electronvolt}$ corresponds to 42 times the room
    temperature. That's hotter than the surface of the Sun!

    At low temperatures (which is all reasonable temperatures), the
    exponential dominates. This is the reason it was acceptable to
    pack $T^{1.5}$ along with constants into the factor $K$.
*** Curve fitting
    SDL wasn't used in this analysis. However, the uncertainty of the
    parameter $K$ was very high: the estimated value returned by
    ~scipy~ was 77096185770 with the standard
    deviation 103821309059. The standard deviation exceeds the value
    itself by over 30% which is very poor accuracy. Essentially,
    ~scipy~ fit the model such as to minimize the uncertainty in $b$,
    which comes at the expense of the uncertainty in $K$. The main
    reason for this is that the exponential becomes is very small,
    which needs to be compensated by making $K$ very large. Hence the
    high uncertainty.

    It is also evident from Figure [[fig:dc]] that the model doesn't fit
    the data at lower temperatures very well.

*** Dark current at $\SI{0}{\celsius}$
    The value corresponding $\SI{0}{\celsius}$ in Table [[tab:dc]] is
    $0.46~e^-/\mathrm{px/s}$, which is about one half of the value
    reported by the manufacturer. Note, that this is not an error in
    the fitted function, but the actual
    measurement. $1~e^-/\mathrm{px/s}$ is seen only when the
    temperature gets close to $\SI{10}{\celsius}$.

    There can be many possible reasons for this such as:
    - using a very small region of the frame when computing the ADU
      bias, or a region with a defect
    - presence of ambient electric fields near the camera
    - read noise is not Gaussian or there's a general tendency to
      "lose" some electrons during the readout when the counts are
      very low
    - the manufacturer simply rounded the value off to 1 making it an
      upper bound
    - the exposure time was not accurately reported

    Verifying the first and last hypotheses is easy if raw frames are
    available; verifying the second one would require moving the
    camera elsewhere and retaking the data. As for the third one, it
    can be verified by making the exposure very long and making sure
    more dark current electrons are accumulated.
* Summary
  There's no doubt that understanding the characteristics of CCD
  sensors is vital when practicing observational astronomy. Errors
  introduced into the data (for instance from using the sensor outside
  of its linear range) will propagate into the data analysis and put
  the validity of the predictions at risk. This project clearly
  demonstrated that when astronomers understand how CCDs work, and
  what are their limitations, they can make informed decisions about
  their observation which in many cases can help avoid producing a
  pile of digital garbage instead of useful data.

  In this work, we investigated CCD gain and read noise and practiced
  estimating them based on the statistics of regions taken from bias
  and flat field frames; we explored the linearity of CCD, determined
  the likely linear range of the ~ST-10XME~ camera, discussed
  potential issues with the data and suggested their possible
  explanations. Finally, we applied a variation of the Meyer-Neldel
  rule to characterize the temperature dependence of the dark current
  in a CCD and estimated the band gab in silicon by fitting a model to
  the data.
