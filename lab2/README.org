* General comments
  In what follows, ~astropy~ was used to handle the FITS files. Note
  that when displayed via ~matplotlib~, the images appear flipped
  along the vertical axis compared to how tools like QFitsView render
  them. It is easy to correct for that, but I chose not to. The code
  pertinent to this analysis is posted under
  [[https://github.com/wdecay/ASTR480/tree/master/lab2]].
* Section 1: Examining fits files
** Question 1
   Figures [[fig:frm]] and [[fig:fr]] show some of the features present in the
   flat image. Some of the most obvious ones are the dark overscan
   region going from top to bottom in the middle, a thin horizontal
   strip of dark pixels in the middle, various defects of the CCD
   (like that shown in Figure [[fig:fr]], Region #3), and the noise which
   becomes apparent when zooming in on a specific region.

   The brightness of the pixels is not uniform even across the bright
   spot. There are several reasons for that. One reason is related to
   diffraction effects closer to the edges of the projected frame
   created by the vignette filter. Another reason has to do with the
   fact that CCDs often exhibit a systematic pixel-to-pixel structure,
   which manifests itself in hot or dead pixels (or entire strips
   thereof), as well as more subtle variations of the pixels' quantum
   efficiency across different regions.

** Question 2
   The table below presents the statistics of the regions shown in
   Figure [[fig:fr]].
   
| Region | Number of pixels |         Mean | Standard Deviation |
|--------+------------------+--------------+--------------------|
| #1     |            10000 | 41306.996600 |         174.056696 |
| #2     |            10000 | 41078.176700 |        5818.827523 |
| #3     |            12000 | 42253.985333 |        1147.204912 |
| #4     |            20000 |   352.360000 |           3.736910 |
** Question 3
   All the histograms in Figure [[fig:hf]] show normal distributions of
   noise centered roughly around the median. Regions #2 and #3 had
   dark outliers from the overscan and the horizontal stitch, which
   shifted the mean to the left. By comparing region #4 with the rest,
   we see that the signal to noise ratio is approximately Poissonian
   with the noise being of the order of $\sqrt{N}$.

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\linewidth :placement [H]
   #+LABEL: fig:hf
   [[file:img/flat_histograms.png]]

   The widths of the distributions describing regions #1-#3
   (discarding the outliers) are similar[fn:width]; however, the
   distributions are centered around different medians. The reason for
   that is that these three regions are located (at least partially)
   on different quadrants on the CCD chip. These quadrants may be read
   out independently, which means that the bias voltages may
   vary. Note that the selected overscan region contains pixels from
   all four quadrants. Generally, 4 different overscan regions (easily
   seen in Figure [[fig:fr]], Region #4) should be characterized
   independently.

[fn:width] It is evident that the distribution describing region #2 is
   a little wider than the distributions describing regions #1 and
   #3. This, at least in part, has to do with the fact that the
   quadrant in the bottom right corner seems to be more brighter than
   the rest, possibly due to higher bias voltage during read-out. This
   manifests in a noticeably greater median and higher Poissonian
   noise.
** Question 4
   Figure [[fig:rmb]] shows regions of different sizes on the bias image
   and the table below presents the statistics of these regions.
   #+CAPTION: Bias image with regions.
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\linewidth :placement [H]

   [[file:img/bias_region_map.png]]
   
| Region | Number of pixels |       Mean | Standard Deviation |
|--------+------------------+------------+--------------------|
| #1     |             25.0 | 257.280000 |           1.908298 |
| #2     |            900.0 | 257.245556 |           2.137686 |
| #3     |           8100.0 | 257.330123 |           2.191376 |
| #4     |          72900.0 | 257.364911 |           2.185746 |
| #5     |        1500000.0 | 259.678465 |           7.139645 |
| #6     |         810000.0 | 263.308036 |           9.645201 |
** Question 5
   The first 4 regions are within the same quadrant and for that
   reason there's only a small drift of the mean value as the size of
   the region gets larger. The standard deviation of the first 4
   regions also doesn't substantially differ. As for the largest
   region #5, there's a substantial increase in the standard deviation
   and a shift of mean by a little more than 2. The reason is that
   this region includes all for quadrants on the CCD, each having its
   own statistical properties. In short, the distribution describing
   region #5 is a combination of 4 different distributions pertaining
   to each of the quadrants. This, in fact, can be seen from the
   histograms describing quadrants #4 and #6 in Figure [[fig:bh]]. By
   adding these distributions centered around different mean values,
   we would get approximately the distribution of region #5 which is
   wider than all its constituents. Apparently the forth quadrant has
   many hot pixels, which is the reason its standard deviation is much
   higher than that of the rest.

*** Question 6
    From the header, we find that the telescope use is the APO 3.5m
    with the "Wash M" filter. I suppose that stands for the Washington
    vignette filter whose effect can be see in Figure [[fig:hcg]]. The
    instrument is specified as "arctic" which is a general purpose,
    visible-wavelength CCD camera.
*** Question 7
    The RA and DEC from the header are:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
RA      = '15:59:15.82'        / RA hours, extrapolated from TCC ObjNetPos      
DEC     = '20:44:36.00'        / Dec degrees, extrapolated from TCC ObjNetPos   
#+END_EXAMPLE
    The coordinates given by NED are ~RA 15h59m11.9s~, ~DEC
    +20d45m31s~. According to the ARC 3.5m ARCTIC
    documentation [fn:arctic], the full field of view is somewhere on
    the order of several arcmin per each side. The small discrepancy
    accounts for the fact that HCG79 is not at the center of the FOV.

    The following arc offsets can also be relevant, but I was not able
    to find any comprehensive information on what exactly they
    represent.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ARCOFFX = +1.5278000000000E-02 / TCC arc offset X                               
    ARCOFFY = -1.5278000000000E-02 / TCC arc offset Y                               
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Question 8
    The following 3 header fields are related to the CCD temperature.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CCDHEAD =                186.8 / CCD cold head temperature (K)                  
CCDTEMP =                150.4 / CCD temperature (K)                            
CCDHEAT =                 68.5 / CCD heater level (percent)    
#+END_EXAMPLE
    The CCD is cooled with liquid nitrogen.

    The object being observed here is known as the Seyfert's Sextet
    (HCG79), which is a group of galaxies about 190 million
    light-years away. The shapes of these galaxies can be easily seen
    in the bottom right quadrant in Figure [[fig:hcg]]. Figure
    [[fig:hcg_zoom]] shows a silly false-color close-up of these galaxies.

    [[file:img/hcg79_zoom.png]]
*** Question 9
    The astronomical features in Figure [[fig:hcg]] include the galaxies
    mentioned earlier as well as some nearby stars, which are
    obviously affected by the PSF. Small bright spots not smeared by
    PSF are most likely cosmic ray hits which are inevitable at longer
    exposures. The dark border is due to the vignette filter. The four
    quadrants are a feature of the quad read-out mode. They don't
    represent any physical separation of the CCD sensor (and of course
    are instrumental features!).
** NGC 2998

  [[file:img/ngc2998.png]]  
*** Question 10
    From the header, we find that the telescope use is the APO 3.5m
    with an "Empty" filter (which most likely means there was no
    filter). The instrument is specified as "DIS," which stand for
    Dual Imaging Spectrograph; is it clear that Figure [[fig:ngc]]
    represents a spectrum. The header also indicate that a diffraction
    grating is present. Some of its parameters are:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
GRATING = 'B400'               / Grating name                                   
PIXSCAL2= +4.1400000000000E-01 / spatial coordinate pixel scale (arcsec/pixel)  
DISPDW  = +1.8500000000000E+00 / Approximate dispersion, (A/pix)                
DISPWC  = +4.3980000000000E+03 / Approximate center wavelength, (A)             
LINESMM = +4.0000000000000E+02 / Grating lines/mm                               
BLAZEANG= +9.9990000000000E+01 / Grating blaze angle 
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Question 11
    The RA and DEC from the header are:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
RA      = '9:48:43.63'         / RA hours, extrapolated from TCC ObjNetPos      
DEC     = '44:04:52.60'        / Dec degrees, extrapolated from TCC ObjNetPos   
#+END_EXAMPLE
    The coordinates given by NED are~ RA 09h48m43.632s~, ~DEC
    +44d04m53.18s~. The discrepancy here is much smaller than in the
    case of HCG79. Perhaps because the telescope is pointed directly
    at the object without arc offsets. I don't know how exactly the
    spectrograph is set up, but likely it only captures a small
    fraction of the field of view at the center through a slit.
*** Question 12
    The following 2 header fields are related to the CCD temperature.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CCDTEMP = +1.7040000000000E+02 / CCD temperature (deg K)                     
CCDHEAT = +1.0000000000000E+02 / CCD heater level (percent)
#+END_EXAMPLE
    The CCD temperature is $\SI{170.4}{\kelvin}$.

    The object being observed here is known as the NGC 2998 barred
    spiral galaxy about 195 million light-years away. Of course, the
    galaxy itself cannot be seen on the spectrogram.
*** Question 13
    The only astronomical feature in Figure [[fig:ngc]] is the vertical
    spectral lines from NGC 2998 (which I will not attempt to describe
    without having access to a calibration spectrum). Some are
    obviously emission lines (like the bright one roughly in the
    middle), but some absorption lines are also prominent. All small
    bright spots are from cosmic ray hits. Taking a spectrogram of a
    faint object requires very long exposures. In this case, the
    header tells us the exposure was $\SI{1800}{\second}$, or 30
    minutes! That is the reason there are so many cosmic ray hits in
    this image. Note that this image wasn't taking using the quad
    read-out mode, so it has no visible "quadrants."
