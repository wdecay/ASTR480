#+TITLE: Pulsations of the ZZ Ceti star J1903+6035
#+AUTHOR: Andrew Ivanov, Nian Tong
\begin{abstract}
We confirm the newly discovered \cite{Vincent_2020} pulsations of the J1903+6035 white dwarf
using the 0.5-m Astrophysical Research Consortium Small Aperture Telescope (ARCSAT).
In 2020, Vincent et al., acquired high-speed photometric observation of J1903+6035
and produced a light curve with complex features and a dominant \SI{726}{\second} pulsation mode;
their use of a 2.6-m telescope allowed for fast \SI{10}{\second} exposures, which made producing
a light curve relatively easy. In this work we demonstrate the possibility of observing
pulsations of high-amplitude ZZ Ceti stars having dominant mode periods of \SI{500}{\second} and longer
through small-diameter telescopes requiring significantly longer exposures (approx. \SI{100}{\second}).
We demonstrate a possible data reduction approach and discuss its applicability when observing similar
objects. Finally, we provide a brief survey of several physical models describing ZZ Ceti pulsators and
discuss how well they describe the observed behavior of J1903+6035.
\end{abstract}
* Introduction
  Pulsations of ZZ Ceti stars provide an excellent window into the
  properties and evolution of white dwarf stars lying within the
  instability strip. Typical period of these stars (also known as DAV)
  range between $\SI{100}{\second}$ and $\SI{2000}{\second}$, and are
  always a combination of several /g/-mode oscillations. For instance
  the oscillations, of the first confirmed ZZ Ceti, HL Tau 76, are
  dominated by two modes with periods \SI{746.2}{\second} and
  \SI{494.2}{\second}[[cite:Koester_1990]].

  The multi-mode nature of ZZ Ceti star pulsations along with the
  observed positive correlation between the period and amplitude
  [[cite:Vincent_2020]] makes producing light curves with reasonable
  time resolution difficult even for relatively slow pulsators. Our
  best achievable time resolution of about $\SI{100}{\second}$
  certainly wouldn't allow resolving all the modes of J1903+6035;
  however, we demonstrate the possibility of resolving the most
  prominent mode by means of differential photometry and subsequent
  Fourier analysis. We confirm that our analysis produces a result
  consistent with that from Vincent et al., and discuss further steps
  and improvements to the observation and data reduction techniques
  which could be helpful to amature astronomers interested in studying
  DAV white dwarvfs through small telescopes.  
* Data reduction and analysis
  The total of 93 raw images were taken with a $\SI{100}{\second}$
  exposure and through the ~sdss_g~ filter. Bias has been subtracted
  from each gain-corrected image and after that flat-field correction
  was performed. To perform differential photometry, we chose 12
  reference stars not sigficantly different from J1903+6035 in their
  apparent magnitude using one of the images as the reference frame
  (Figure [[fig:field]]).

  #+CAPTION: whereas those labeled as Cx are supposedly non-variable control stars.
  #+NAME: fig:field

  Due to a significant variation in the positions of the stars in
  different frames taken over the course of observation, it was
  necessary to compute a homography transformation between each of the
  frames and the reference frame. This was done using the ~astroalign~
  Python module. Generally, results were good to about 1-2 pixels; to
  further improve the signal-to-noise ratio the coordinats of each
  star were optimized by fitting a narrow 2D Gaussian near the
  frame-shift-corrected location of the star.

  The differential photometry procedure was performed as follows: the
  flux (in the units of $e^-$) was computed via aperture photometry
  method for the main and reference stars in each of the frames; then
  the relative flux of the main star was determined as the ratio of
  its flux and the average flux of all the reference stars. This
  produced the light curve shown in Figure [[fig:lc]].

  #+NAME: fig:lc
  [[./img/lightcurve.png]]

  As seen from the light curve in Figure [[fig:lc]], typical time
  intervals between successive measurements were approximately uniform
  ($117\pm10\SI{}{\second}$), so it isn't unreasonable to attempt
  producing a power spectrum via Fast Foutier Transform (FFT). The
  result is shown in Figure [[fig:ps]].
  
  #+CAPTION: Power spectrum of the relative magnitude of J1903+6035.
  #+NAME: fig:ps
  [[./img/power.png]]

  It is quite clear that the power spectrum is strongest near
  $f\approx\SI{1.3}{\milli\hertz}$, which corresponds to the period of
  about $\SI{770}{\second}$. There's another somewhat prominent
  feature in the power spectrum near $f\approx\SI{2.2}{\milli\hertz}$,
  which corresponds to the period of about $\SI{450}{\second}$. Due to
  a technical issue, there was a discontinuity in the light curve data
  with multiple missing data points (see Figure [[fig:lc]], near
  $t\approx\SI{5000}{\second}$). It needs more investigation how that
  affected the power spectrum and if it would help imputing the
  missing data points. However, we will not puruse Fourier analysis
  any further because the Lomb-Scargle periodogram would be a more
  appropriate technique for deriving the period from this data.

  A Lomb-Scargle periodogram obtained from the light curve in Figure
  [[fig:lc]] is shown in Figure [[fig:ls]]. Note that it echoes the periously
  discussed power spectrum confirming the presense of a statistically
  significant dominant mode with period of $\SI{763}{\second}$ and
  another prominent (but not statistically significant) mode with a
  period near $\SI{450}{\second}$.

  To further validate the statistical significance of this result and
  confirm that it didn't arise from an error in the analysis or some
  unknown digital artifact, we perform the same data reduction
  procedue again, but having J1903+6035 replaced with different
  (supposedly non-variable) stars. These "control group" stars are
  maked as C1 and C2 in Figure [[fig:field]]. The resulting light curves,
  power spectra and Lomb-Scargle periodograms are shown in Figures
  [[fig:lc1]] - [[fig:ls3]]. (Some of these figures will be combined and
  presented as subplots. For now, just pesenting everythign as is.)


  It is obvious that the lightcurves for stars C1 and C3 have strongly
  correlated (TODO: quantify correlation) slow frequency oscillations
  ($\SI{2000}{\second} < P < \SI{3000}{\second}$), which also show up
  in the corresponding power spectra and periodograms (however, the
  statistical significance reported by the Lomb-Scargle analysis is
  low because the number of captured periods would be less than 5). It
  is not clear what is the sourse of this variation, but it's most
  certainly artificial. The fact that no control star exhibited any
  even slightly statistically significant variation with a frequency
  close to the one determined for J1903+6035 suggests that detected
  variation was not due to any artificial signal and is, indeed, due
  to the actual variation in brightness.

  Comments: Most of the effort when preparing this draft was put into
  reducing the data and trying to determine whether there was any
  signal. The SNR is very low, so this took some careful data
  reduction. At this point I am quite confident that there's
  statistically significant signal (yay!), so the path forward seems
  pretty clear. The TODO items below should give the general idea
  where this will be going next.
