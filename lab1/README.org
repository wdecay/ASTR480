* Object type and catalog
  I want to observe Kepler objects of interest (KOI). The full catalog
  (NASA Exoplanet Archive) in the CSV format is available at
  https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/nstedAPI/nph-nstedAPI?table=cumulative
  and the columns are documented at
  https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_kepcandidate_columns.html
* Observatory assignment & observing window
  According to the first letter of my last name, the observatory
  assignment is McDonald Observatory, Texas.

  Observations are planned for May 14th, 2021. I'm interpreting this
  as follows: the observation windows starts at the beginning of the
  astronomical twilight on May 14th local time (CDT) and continues
  until the end of the astronomical twilights on May 15th.
* Moon interference
  At midnight of the observation window the phase angle of the moon
  was estimated at about $\SI{143}{\degree}$. Apparently, Astroplan
  doesn't follow the sign convention for the phase angle, and it is
  not possible to distinguish between waning and waxing phases. It
  does, however, allow to determine the illuminated portion, which was
  estimated at about $10\%$. (Other online tools report that the Moon
  will be in the waxing crescent phase on that day).

  From the altitude vs. time graph, we can see that the Moon will not
  reach an altitude higher than about $\SI{15}{\degree}$ above the
  horizon on the night of May 14th and will be below the horizon about
  half an hour prior to midnight. This, combined with a relatively low
  illumination of the Lunar disk, means that the Moon will not
  interfere with the observations in a significant way as long as we
  are not trying to observe a low-altitude object close to the Moon
  before midnight. The best time is after the moonset (i.e., roughly
  after midnight).
* Visible objects
  The initial dataset consisted of 50 brighest KOIs that have been
  confirmed to be planetary systems. The Kepler space telescope had a
  fixed field of view against the sky with the center at about RA 19h
  22m 40s DEC +44 30' 00". This means that there's not a lot of spread
  in the locations of the KOIs and if one of them is visible, most
  likely so are the rest. This makes the task easier, but the code
  wasn't written with such assumption and will be applicable to
  datasets with arbitrarily spread-out objects. Visibility is
  determined based on whether the object is above the horizon
  (altitude greater than zero) during the astronomical twilight
  window.

  An Astropy-assistent calculation showed that of these 50 object all
  reached the altitude above $\SI{69}{\degree}$ and several the
  altitude above $\SI{80}{\degree}$. The highest altitude was also
  reached past midnight with the Moon blow the horizon making for
  favorable observational conditions.

  To reduce the dataset down to 10 objects, KOIs with the shortest
  orbital period were selected. Their altitudes vs time are shown in
  the figure below. As can be seen, they are indeed fairly close to
  each other on the sky.

* Observations a month later
  It is easy to generate another altitude vs time graph for the same
  10 objects for a date a month later. The Moon's illumination,
  according to Astroplan will be about $21\%$, and the moonset is a
  little less than an hour past midnight. The drawbacks of observing
  on this day are that the Moon is a little brighter and visible for
  slightly longer than before; and the night is a little shorter. This
  can all be seen in the graph below.

  The good news, however, is that the KOIs culminate during the
  observation window with the Moon off the sky. All in all, it appears
  that the conditions a month later are slightly better than before
  because there's a good opportunity to observe the KOIs through the
  lowest possible airmass.
* Accessing code and data
  The code used to produce the graphs and process the data is
  available on GitHub at
  https://github.com/wdecay/ASTR480/tree/master/lab1. The relevant
  files are ~lab1.ipynb~ and ~observation.py~. The latter contains a
  relatively generic code which can be used to produce graphs similar
  to the ones presented here for an arbitrary set of objects.

  Currently, the repo is public. Please sent me your GitHub ID and I
  will make it private and share it with you. I prefer writing my code
  in a modular way and sharing it via Canvas can get a little
  annoying.
